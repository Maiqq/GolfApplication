    <string name="general">This parser works as following. It reads in two arrays, one containing registry values and the other manual values for registers.
    It starts by checking the manual array for information on how to handle incoming registers. Such information is for a example amount of registers to combine into one value as well as the output format. Once it got the information it starts by converting the registry input into a hex string and adds another string if needed according to the manual  of how many registers to combine.</string>
